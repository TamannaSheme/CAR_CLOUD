# CAR_CLOUD

## Project Description
The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed overview of our software product, its parameters and goals. This project document describes the project's target audience and its user interface, hardware and software requirements. The aim of this document is to gather and analyze and give an in-depth insight of the complete Online Car Selling , Buying, Renting, Getting idea about car by defining the problem statement in detail. The detailed requirements of the Car Cloud are provided in this document.

### Problem definition 
We're automating the vehicle bazaar by bringing buyers and sellers together in one place. Dealers can add their car details. All required features are also previewed there. Buyer can search any of the car according to his/her required features. User can view dealer feedback and reputation as added by previous buyers. We also add the blog where persons can discuss and share their views about cars. From this website time is saved.
The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for the users to buy and sale the cars. Our project Online Car Cloud includes dealing between seller and buyers. Our website has the facility to give a unique id for every user and details of every user and the staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current status of each related website. User can search availability of a deals related website using the id. The user can be entered using a username and password. It is accessible either by a seller or buyer. User can enter their requirements, actually describes what the user want. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.

### Motivation
The proposed website is Car Cloud. The system will be used to get the information from the users and then storing that data for future usage. The current system in use is a paper-based system. It is too slow and cannot provide the information about existing users. The intentions of the system are to reduce over-time pay and increase the number of users that can be treated accurately. Requirements statements in this document are bot functional and non-functional. We are going to develop an online project for customers where they can get information about buy and sale of cars easily. 
The main purpose of this web application is to provide an online vehicle showroom and to allow users to book vehicles online. Customers can sign up for this platform and use their login credentials to book vehicles. The administrator is the device's primary operator, and he or she will input personnel and new car information. There is no car-selling or-buying website in Bangladesh. Because our country is still developing, many individuals are unaware of auto buying and selling methods, as well as which car is best for them based on their budget. Also included are the Automobile Insurance System and the Automobile Parts Replacement System. As a result, our system will assist in resolving all of these issues.
 
### Business Model
We have two main users on our website: automobile vendors and car purchasers. Those who register and purchase cars on our website will receive a bonus discount. Furthermore, each regular user who consults with our expert will receive free service for the first three sessions. Our system also includes a car rental service, allowing any user to rent a vehicle. If a customer rents a car more than five times, he or she will receive a 2% discount. Car parts, insurance, battery replacement, oil change, and car purchasing and selling ideas are also available.

### Technologies - Programming Language, Database, Others 
	Programming language: Programming language that will be used in the backend of this software system is PHP. It is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. 
	Web Framework: Laravel web framework will be used to develop this system. It is a PHP web framework which can be used for rapid development. It can be used to make a secure website with clean and maintainable design. 
	Database: For the database, MySQL will be used to store all the information. MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).MySQL is renowned for being the most secure and reliable database management system used in web applications. Not only this, MySQL can be relied upon to make high performance websites to ensure optimum speed. 
	Frontend: For frontend, Bootstrap will be used to make the website responsive and mobile-first. So, users can access all features in all devices. Java Script will also be used to make the website interactive. 
	Authentication Technology: JSON.
	IDE/Editor: Sublime Text, Visual Studio, PHPStrom.
	Version Controlling System: Git.

### Debugging
Debugging is an essential part in software application development. To remove the faults and making the application clean debugging process is very much required. If bugs are present in the application, it can drastically effect app performance and may can even cause freeze and crash.
While developing our project on VS Code and PyCharm a number of automated debugging tools were in our disposal. But we did not essentially rely on those tools. We simply tried to understand what is happening in each line of code when facing difficulties.

### Challenges 
	 In the face of the pandemic, we, those who are responsible to develop the software will not able to go out and communicate with different people to see what potential users may actually want from this system. So, all we were able to do is brainstorm and decide on as many features as we can to include in this system. 
	This software system is quite a large project. We were able brainstorm a lot of features that we wanted to include in this project. However due to the limited number of team members and limited time, we will not be able to include all the possible features in this system before the project deadline. 
	The language and framework that are going to be used are fairly new to us, the software developers. So, it will take some time for the team members to get familiar to the new language and framework used, that is PHP.
	We have to make sure that the user interface is not too technical so that all the users find it easy to use. 
	Since this project is entirely team driven, we lack any client or upper-management feedback. Lacking well-defined client-requirements will make the development process a little more difficult.
	Our team members are eager to work in a professional environment. This lead us to use Version control system such as Git. Our team members are unfamiliar with it but we will try our best to exploit all the functionalities Git can offer.
	Furthermore, we would like to create API to improve reusability of our developed codes.

### Future Plan
	We love the UI as it is but we think it can be improved so that the users can navigate more easily and smoothly. That is why we will work on the UI and make it perfect
	Some limitations are there while customizing profile, creating posts and interacting with other’s post. We would like to improve user experience by adding new feature to these actions.
	As of right now users can only rent car but for future, we want to add car buy, car sell, car fixing options.
	We would like to add users’ appointment and other features to make this project a complete car care package.
	As of now this is a web application that can be accessed to any device. But we would like to bring it to hand held platform by turning it into an android app so that anyone can use it anywhere anytime.


### Conclusion 
The project's primary purpose was to reach out to anyone who was looking for a car. We are optimistic that we will be able to attain our target at this time. Car Cloud is capable of living up to its title. A website that will provide assistance and support to individuals who are in need. We aspire to provide assistance to anybody, everywhere, and at any time by forming a helpful community.
